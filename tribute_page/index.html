        <p>Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace<p/>
        <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face<p/>
        <p>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool<p/>
        <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?<p/>
        <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene,<p/>
        <p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends<p/>

        <p>And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more<p/>
        <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say<p/>
